# Capture xMatters Instance Data (capture-instance-data.py)

A Python utility to capture as much xMatters Instance data as possible to help in recovering from an unforseen catastrophe.  The script currently backs-up the following information:

* Sites
* Users
* Devices with Timeframes
* Groups and Shifts
  * **Caveat**: Group Observers are not able to be captured at this time.  Once the xMatters [`Get a group xM API`](https://help.xmatters.com/xmapi/index.html#get-a-group) and [`Create a group xM API`](https://help.xmatters.com/xmapi/index.html#create-a-group) can handle capturing and restoring those values, we can include them.

The information is preserved in timestamped files so that you can run this via automation as often as you like.  The file formats are dependent on the type of information, and are in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.  This makes it easier for recovery.  Then, if a catastropy does happen, you will have the information necessary to recover most of your environment by using the companion [Restore xMatters Instance Data](https://github.com/xmatters/xm-labs-restore-instance-data) Utility.

 One important caveat is that an xMatters Instance is also formed based on a set of Administrative Data that is unable to be captured or restored from an automated perspective.  Still, this utility creates a file that lists the Administrative Objects that are in use by the captured data.  These Administrative Objects will need to either already exists in the target environment, or be re-created with the same exact same names (Spelling, capitalization, punctuation):

* Roles (and their associated Function),
* Countrys,
* Languages,
* Time Zones,
* Device Names, and
* User Service Providers (the internal handlers for the various Device Types)

This information may be given to xMatters Support, who can help with ensuring that your target environment is ready for recovery.

## Pre-Requisites

* [Python 3.7.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/) (I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to get and manage your python installations)
* Python [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module (`pip install requests`)
* Details for the xMatters instance to be captured (e.g. Non-Production vs Production, URL, a Company Supervisor's User ID and Password, etc.)

## Files

* [capture-instance-data.py](capture-instance-data.py) - Main driver/starting point.
* [config.py](config.py) - Defines the config object used by the program, and error messages
* [common_logger.py](common_logger.py) - Provides logging capabilities to the utility.
* [cli.py](cli.py) - The Command Line processor that handles dealing with command line arguments, as well as rading the defaults.json file.
* [processor.py](processor.py) - The guts of the utility where all of the interactions from xMatters to the local file system occurs.
* [defaults.json](defaults.json) - Example default property settings.  You may override these with command line arguments too.

## How it works

The utility expects several inputs via the command-line (and optionally the defaults file) to get started.  The inputs tell the utility where the information exists, and which specific information you want to have captured:

* `all` - the most common case; captures Sites, Users, Devices (and Timeframes), Groups (and Shifts).
* `sites` - Just Sites (but not Devices)
* `users` - Just Users (but not Devices)
* `devices` - Just Devices and Timeframes
* `groups` - Just Groups and Shifts

Upon specifying the inputs, the utility runs until completion as it retrieves the requested data from the source instance, and writes tha informaiton out to your local file system.  The locations of the output files, and their base filename may be specified via the command line or the defauts file too.

## Installation

### Python / pyenv setup

* [Python 3.7.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/) (I recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to get and manage your python installations)
* After pyenv is installed, go to the directory where you downloaded the files from this repository.
   1. `pyenv install 3.7.1` - Installs Python v3.7.1 into your local system (You only need to do this once)
   2. `pyenv local 3.7.1` - Makes Python v3.7.1 the default for _this_ project (you only need to do this once per project)
   3. _[For Linux/Max OS X]_ - `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` - Initializes pyenv for command line access to Python  (you need to do this whenver you open a Terminal windows unless you do step 5 below)
   4. _[For Linux/Mac OS X]_ - `pyenv shell 3.7.1` - Sets up access to Pythons tools from the command line (e.g. `pip`)
   5. `echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile` - makes sure Pyenv is initialized whenver you open a Terminal window.
   6. _[Optional]_ `pyenv global 3.7.1` - Sets Python v3.7.1 as your global instance of Python
* Install the Python [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) module
  * `pip install requests`

### capture-instance-data.py setup

All you need to do now is to create an appropriate [defaults.json](defaults.json).  Use the included version for an example:

   ```text
   {

   // Your xMatters base instances base URL
   "xmodURL": "https://<mycompany>.<myserver>.xmatters.com",

   // An xMatters User ID with the "Company Supervisor" Role
   "user": "MyUser",

   // The User's Password
   "password": "MyPassword",

   // The directory to place output and log files
   // (the default is the current directory)
   "outDirectory": ".",

   // The character used between directory paths.
   // (change to \ for Windows)
   "dirSep": "/",

   // The base part of the file name to use for captured data
   // e.g. "catured-data"
   "baseName": "BASE-FILE-NAME-FOR-CAPTURED-DATA",

   // The base part of the file name to use for runtime logging
   // e.g. "catured-data-logging"
   "logFilename": "capture-instance-data-results",

   // Corresponds to the level of details you want in the log file
   // (0=only errors, 1=only warnings, 2=info)
   "verbosity": 0,

   // Identifies whether the captured information is from your
   // Non-Production or Production instance
   "instance":  "np|prod"
   }
   ```

                        files will be written.
  -p [PASSWORD]         If not specified in the defaults file, use -p to
                        specify a password either on the command line, or be

                        means add DEBUG logging [default: 0]
  -x XMOD_URL, --xmodurl XMOD_URL
